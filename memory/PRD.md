### 20. Integrated Amazon Order → Bigship Flow in Bot ✅
**Date**: April 13, 2026

**Overview:**
Integrated Bigship shipping label generation directly into the Operations Assistant Bot. After uploading invoice during order processing, accountants can now:

**Shipping Options After Invoice Upload:**
1. **Generate via Bigship** - Create B2B or B2C shipping labels
2. **Enter Tracking ID** - Manually enter existing tracking number
3. **Use Amazon Tracking** - For EasyShip orders (Amazon handles delivery)
4. **Upload Existing Label** - Upload pre-created shipping label

**Bigship Flow in Bot:**
1. Select shipment type (B2C Single/Surface or B2B Heavy)
2. Enter/confirm phone number (or type 'none' for EasyShip)
3. Enter weight and dimensions (auto-filled from Master SKU if available)
4. Enter delivery pincode (auto-filled from Amazon order if available)
5. View rates from 28+ courier partners
6. Select courier and confirm booking
7. For B2B > ₹50,000: Enter E-Way Bill number
8. Download shipping label directly from bot

**New Bot Commands:**
- `shipping_bigship` - Start Bigship label generation
- `shipping_enter_tracking` - Manual tracking ID entry
- `shipping_amazon_tracking` - Use Amazon-provided tracking
- `download_label_{order_id}` - Download label for manifested shipment

**New Backend Endpoint:**
- `POST /api/bot/update-tracking` - Updates tracking ID on pending_fulfillment/dispatches/amazon_orders

**Testing**: 100% passed - Backend: 21/21 tests (Iteration 76, 77, 78) ✅

**Known Limitations**:
- Bigship shipment creation for B2B requires 12-digit e-waybill number
- Orders > ₹50,000 require e-waybill document upload (PDF) per Bigship API requirements
- These are Bigship API validations, not limitations in CRM code

---

### 19. Master SKU Shipping Dimensions (LBH & Weight) ✅
**Date**: April 13, 2026

**Overview:**
Added Length, Breadth, Height (LBH) and Weight fields to Master SKU for automatic shipping rate calculation with Bigship API.

**Changes:**
1. **Database/Backend:**
   - Added `length_cm`, `breadth_cm`, `height_cm`, `weight_kg` fields to MasterSKU models
   - POST /api/master-skus now saves LBH/Weight on creation
   - PATCH /api/master-skus/{id} updates LBH/Weight fields

2. **Frontend Table:**
   - Replaced BOM and Aliases columns with LBH (cm) and Weight columns
   - Format: "50x40x30" for LBH, "25.5 kg" for weight
   - SKUs without dimensions show "Not set" in orange color

3. **Create/Edit Dialogs:**
   - New "Shipping Dimensions (for Courier Labels)" section
   - Input fields for Length, Breadth, Height (cm) and Weight (kg)

### Bug Fixes (April 13, 2026)

#### FEATURE: Amazon PII Collection During Import ✅
**Issue**: Amazon SP-API restricts PII data (buyer name, phone, full address) for most orders
**Solution**: When processing Amazon orders with missing customer details, bot now asks accountant to enter:
1. Customer First Name
2. Customer Last Name  
3. Full Shipping Address
4. Phone Number (if missing)

Data is saved to both `pending_fulfillment` and `amazon_orders` collections for Bigship label generation.

#### BUG FIX: Bigship B2C risk_type Validation ✅
**Issue**: B2C rate calculation failing with "risk_type should be empty for shipment_category B2C"
**Fix**: Backend now conditionally sets `risk_type`: empty for B2C, "OwnerRisk" for B2B

#### BUG FIX: Bigship Invoice Amount Must Be Integer ✅
**Issue**: Rate calculation failing with "It should be a 6-digit only" error
**Root Cause**: `shipment_invoice_amount` was passed as float (60000.0) instead of integer
**Fix**: Changed to `int(float(request.get("invoice_amount") or 0))`

#### BUG FIX: Master SKU LBH/Weight Not Loaded in Bot ✅
**Issue**: Bot always asked for weight/dimensions even when Master SKU had them
**Root Cause**: `prepare-dispatch` endpoint wasn't looking up SKU mapping for Amazon orders
**Fix**: Added fallback to lookup `sku_mappings` collection when `master_sku_id` is null

#### BUG FIX: Bigship Invoice Amount Always Zero ✅
**Issue**: When generating shipping via Bigship from the bot, the invoice_amount was always 0, causing Bigship API 400 error "shipment_invoice_amount must be greater than 0"
**Root Cause**: Frontend used `order?.order_total` which was null. The prepare-dispatch endpoint returns `pricing.total_value` instead.
**Fix**: Changed to use `pricing?.total_value || order?.order_total || context.order_total || 0`

#### BUG FIX: Bigship Rate Calculator Validation Error ✅
**Issue**: Bigship calculator API returned 400 "Only OwnerRisk and CarrierRisk is allowed for risk_type"
**Root Cause**: Backend was passing empty string for `risk_type`
**Fix**: Changed default from `""` to `"OwnerRisk"` in calculate-rates endpoint

#### BUG FIX: Bot File Upload Saved to Wrong Field ✅
**Issue**: Invoice uploads in OrderBot were saved with field name `undefined` instead of `invoice_url`
**Root Cause**: Async state issue - `context.awaiting_file` was undefined when `handleFileUpload` ran because `setContext` hadn't completed yet
**Fix**: Added `currentFileFieldRef` (useRef) to store field immediately, avoiding async state issues

#### BUG FIX: Pending Fulfillment Wrong Firm Assignment ✅
**Issue**: Amazon orders showing MGIPL (first active firm) instead of actual selling firm (EBAY UP)
**Root Cause**: Code used `db.firms.find_one({"is_active": True})` instead of `amazon_order.get("firm_id")`
**Fix**: Now uses firm_id from amazon_order, falls back to first active firm only if amazon order has no firm

#### BUG FIX: SKU Mapping Not Found ✅
**Issue**: Amazon orders showing "Unknown" SKU even when mapping exists
**Root Cause**: SKU mapping lookup didn't filter by firm_id
**Fix**: Now tries firm-specific mapping first (`amazon_sku` + `firm_id`), then falls back to global mapping

---

**Tables Updated**:
- Ready to Dispatch table
- Recently Dispatched table
- Recent Dispatches table

### 7. Multi-Item Serial Number Support for Outbound Dispatch ✅
**Date**: April 10, 2026

**Feature**: For multi-piece orders containing manufactured items, the Outbound Dispatch form now asks for serial numbers for each unit separately based on quantity.

**Bug Fixes Applied** (April 10, 2026):
- Fixed: When quantity is 3, system now shows 3 serial number slots (previously showed only 1)
- Fixed: Removed duplicate serial selection UI that was showing twice
- Fixed: Serial dropdown now filters out already-selected serials in other slots

**Implementation Details**:

**Backend Changes** (server.py):
- Added `item_serials` parameter to `POST /api/dispatches` endpoint
- Each serial slot includes: `slot_index`, `item_index`, `unit_index`, `master_sku_id`, `serial_number`
- Each serial number is validated and marked as "dispatched" in the database

**Frontend Changes** (AccountantDashboard.jsx):
- **Serial Slots by Quantity**: For each manufactured item, creates `quantity` number of serial selection slots
- **Example**: Item with Qty: 3 creates 3 serial slots labeled "Unit 1", "Unit 2", "Unit 3"
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Each slot filters out serials already selected in other slots
- **Clear Status**: Shows "X of Y selected" badge with color coding (orange if incomplete, green if all selected)
- **Validation**: Cannot dispatch until all serial slots are filled

**UI Flow**:
1. User selects pending fulfillment order
2. Items are displayed with their quantities
3. For each manufactured item with Qty: N, N serial number dropdowns appear
4. Each dropdown filters out serials selected in other slots
5. User must select serial for each unit before dispatching

**Example**:
- Order: 3x Solar Inverter (manufactured)
- UI shows: Unit 1 dropdown, Unit 2 dropdown, Unit 3 dropdown
- User selects: MG001, MG002, MG003
- All 3 serials are marked as dispatched

**Backend Changes** (server.py):
- Added `item_serials` parameter to `POST /api/dispatches` endpoint (JSON array of `{item_index, master_sku_id, serial_number}`)
- Added `product_type` and `is_manufactured` fields to pending fulfillment items response
- Each manufactured item's serial number is validated and marked as "dispatched" in the database
- Dispatch document stores `item_serials` array for multi-item orders

**Frontend Changes** (AccountantDashboard.jsx):
- Added `itemSerials` state to track serial numbers for each manufactured item
- When selecting a pending fulfillment entry, the system fetches available serial numbers for each manufactured item
- Each manufactured item shows a "Manufactured" badge and a serial number dropdown
- Validation ensures all manufactured items have serial numbers selected before submission
- Summary shows "X of Y serial numbers selected" for manufactured items

**How It Works**:
1. User selects a pending fulfillment order with multiple items
2. Items are displayed with their details (SKU, quantity, stock)
3. Manufactured items show a purple "Manufactured" badge
4. For each manufactured item, a serial number dropdown appears
5. User must select a serial number for each manufactured item
6. On dispatch, all serial numbers are validated and marked as dispatched

**Example Scenario**:
- Order contains: 1x Solar Inverter (manufactured) + 1x Lithium Battery (manufactured)
- System shows 2 serial number dropdowns (one for each manufactured item)
- User selects serial numbers for both items
- Dispatch is created with `item_serials` array containing both serial numbers

## Bug Fixes & Enhancements (April 10, 2026)

### 7.3 Import Payables Report - Wrong Amount - FIXED ✅
**Date**: April 10, 2026

**Issue**: Import supplier (e.g., APS) showed ₹6,08,240.35 as payable, when the actual bank debit was only ₹2,97,615.33. The system was using the grand total landed cost (including duties, shipping, handling) as the payable to supplier.

**Root Cause**: 
- Import purchase entry was setting `balance_due = grand_total_landed_cost`
- But duties are paid to **customs**, expenses to **logistics companies** - NOT to the foreign supplier
- The actual amount owed to the supplier is only the `bank_debit_inr` amount

**Fix Applied** (server.py):
1. When finalizing import shipment, purchase entry now uses:
   - `balance_due = bank_debit_inr` (actual supplier payment)
   - `supplier_payable_amount = bank_debit_inr` (new field for clarity)
   - `total_amount = grand_total_landed_cost` (kept for accounting)
   
2. Payables report updated:
   - For imports: Uses `balance_due` (which is now `bank_debit_inr`)
   - Fallback for old records: Uses `bank_debit_inr` for imports

**Before**: APS Outstanding = ₹6,08,240.35 (wrong - includes duties/expenses)
**After**: APS Outstanding = ₹2,97,615.33 (correct - only bank debit to supplier)

**Note**: Existing import purchase entries need to be updated manually or re-finalized to get corrected `balance_due` values.

### 7.2 Import Costing - GST Inclusive Expense Bug - FIXED ✅
**Date**: April 10, 2026

**Issue**: When entering expenses with "GST Inclusive" option, the system was treating the inclusive amount as the base amount and adding GST on top, resulting in incorrect totals.

**Example of Bug**:
- User enters: ₹8,116 (GST Inclusive)
- System wrongly calculated: Base ₹8,116 + GST ₹1,460.88 = Total ₹9,576.88
- Should be: Base ₹6,877.97 + GST ₹1,238.03 = Total ₹8,116.00

**Root Cause**: 
- POST endpoint (`/api/import-shipments`) didn't check `is_gst_inclusive` flag
- It always calculated GST by multiplying base_amount × gst_rate

**Fix Applied** (server.py):
1. Added `is_gst_inclusive: bool = False` to ImportShipmentExpense model
2. Updated POST endpoint to handle GST inclusive amounts:
   - If inclusive: `base = entered_amount / 1.18`, `gst = entered_amount - base`
   - If exclusive: `gst = entered_amount × 0.18`

**After Fix**:
- Handling Fees (Inclusive ₹8,116): Base ₹6,877.97, GST ₹1,238.03, Total ₹8,116.00 ✅
- Shipping (Exclusive ₹104,816.30): Base ₹104,816.30, GST ₹18,866.93, Total ₹123,683.23 ✅

### 7. Import Costing - Customs Exchange Rate Bug - FIXED ✅
**Date**: April 10, 2026

**Issue**: Import Costing was using the Bank Exchange Rate (calculated from Bank Debit INR / Proforma USD) instead of the Customs Exchange Rate (RBI rate on BOE date) for assessable value calculations. This caused incorrect BCD, SWS, and IGST calculations.

**Root Cause**: 
- Backend was calculating `exchange_rate = bank_debit_inr / proforma_amount_usd`
- This was used for assessable value: `assessable_value = assessable_value_usd * exchange_rate`
- The `customs_exchange_rate` field existed but was not being used

**Fix Applied** (server.py):
- POST endpoint: Uses `customs_exchange_rate` if provided, otherwise falls back to bank rate
- PUT endpoint: Same logic for updates, also triggers recalculation when customs rate changes
- Stores both `exchange_rate` (bank rate for reference) and `customs_exchange_rate` (for BOE calculations)

**Before**: Assessable INR = $1961.01 × 94.063 = ₹1,84,458.84 (WRONG)
**After**: Assessable INR = $1961.01 × 94.25 = ₹1,84,825.55 (CORRECT)

### 7.1 Multi-Quantity Serial Number Dispatch - FIXED ✅
**Date**: April 10, 2026

**Issue**: When dispatching a manufactured item with quantity > 1 (e.g., 3 inverters), the backend was rejecting the dispatch with "Serial number is required for manufactured items" even though all serial numbers were selected via `item_serials`.

**Root Cause**: Backend validation at line ~4284 only checked for `serial_number` parameter (single item) and didn't account for `item_serials` parameter (multi-quantity orders).

**Fix Applied** (server.py):
- Added check for serial numbers in `item_serials` when `serial_number` is not provided
- If manufactured item has serials in `item_serials`, validation passes
- Single `serial_number` validation only runs when that parameter is provided

### 6. Import Shipment Items Disappearing on Edit - FIXED ✅
**Date**: April 10, 2026

**Issue**: When editing and saving an existing import shipment, all items would disappear from the shipment. This was a critical bug that caused users to lose all item/costing data when updating shipments.

**Root Cause**: 
- Frontend (`ImportCosting.jsx`) sends items with `item_id` field
- Backend `PUT /api/import-shipments/{shipment_id}` endpoint was checking for `master_sku_id` during processing
- Additionally, the processed item dictionary referenced `master_sku` variable instead of `item_record`

**Fix Applied** (server.py, lines ~28863-28910):
1. Changed SKU ID lookup to check both `item_id` and `master_sku_id`: `sku_id = item_dict.get("item_id") or item_dict.get("master_sku_id")`
2. Fixed processed item to use `sku_id` variable instead of direct dict access
3. Changed `master_sku.get()` references to `item_record.get()` to use the correct variable
4. Added `item_id` and `item_type` fields to processed item for frontend compatibility

**Testing Done**:
- Created test shipment with items via API ✓
- Edited shipment via API (changed quantity from 10 to 15) ✓
- Verified items persisted in database ✓
- Verified frontend edit dialog shows items correctly ✓

### 6.5 Import Shipment BOE Assessable Value Incorrect on Update - FIXED ✅
**Date**: April 10, 2026

**Issue**: When editing and saving an import shipment, the BOE assessable value calculation was incorrect because it was missing freight and insurance components. The item page showed correct values but the calculations page showed wrong values.

**Root Cause**: 
- The `PUT /api/import-shipments/{shipment_id}` endpoint was calculating assessable value as:
  `assessable_value = unit_price_usd * quantity * exchange_rate`
- This was missing the freight and insurance components which should be:
  `assessable_value = (invoice_value + freight + insurance) * exchange_rate`

**Fix Applied** (server.py, PUT endpoint ~line 28938):
- Added freight calculation: `freight_usd = invoice_value_usd * freight_percent / 100`
- Added insurance calculation: `insurance_usd = invoice_value_usd * insurance_percent / 100`
- Fixed assessable value: `assessable_value_usd = invoice_value_usd + freight_usd + insurance_usd`
- Added all freight/insurance fields to processed item for consistency with POST endpoint

**Before Fix**:
- Invoice: $1619 * 94.1 = ₹1,52,347.90 (wrong - missing freight+insurance)

**After Fix**:
- Invoice: $1619
- Freight (20%): $323.80
- Insurance (1.125%): $18.21
- Total USD: $1961.01
- Assessable INR: $1961.01 * 94.1 = ₹1,84,628.29 (correct)

### 5. Sales Invoice Flow Fixed ✅
**Issues Fixed:**
1. **Fixed dispatches "disappearing"**: When a dispatch is fixed in the Missing Data dialog, the system now automatically tries to create an invoice for it (instead of just updating the dispatch)
2. **Added Recalculate button**: For invoices with ₹0 values (created when pricing was missing), admin can click the yellow refresh button to recalculate values from dispatch/SKU data
3. **Added `POST /api/sales-invoices/from-dispatch/{dispatch_id}`** endpoint to create invoice for a specific dispatch
4. **Added `POST /api/sales-invoices/{invoice_id}/recalculate`** endpoint to recalculate zero-value invoices

**How the flow works now:**
1. When you fix a dispatch (add state, SKU, etc.) → System automatically creates invoice
2. If invoice has ₹0 → Click the yellow Recalculate button → System pulls pricing from dispatch or SKU
3. If still fails → Error shows what's missing (invoice_value on dispatch OR selling_price/mrp/cost_price on SKU)

**For zero-value invoices, user must:**
- Either set `invoice_value` on the dispatch (the total amount paid including GST)
- Or set `selling_price` or `mrp` or `cost_price` on the Master SKU

### 4. Fixed SKU Price Validation Logic ✅
- **Issue**: Sales invoices from dispatches were requiring "sku_price" even though the dispatch already has invoice_value from the original order
- **Root Cause**: The invoice creation logic only looked at Master SKU selling_price, ignoring the dispatch's existing pricing data
- **Fix**: 
  - Updated `create_sales_invoice_from_dispatch()` to prioritize dispatch's `invoice_value` or `taxable_value` over SKU pricing
  - Updated missing_fields validation to skip `sku_price` check if dispatch has its own pricing
  - Added **Selling Price** and **MRP** fields to Master SKU form for future manual sales invoices
  - Added "Set Invoice Value Directly" option in Fix Dispatch dialog for dispatches without pricing

### 1. Fixed Import Shipment Save Error ✅
- **Issue**: "Failed to save shipment" error when editing import shipments
- **Root Cause**: ImportCosting.jsx uses its own `API` constant (`process.env.REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL`) without `/api` prefix, unlike other files that import from App.js which includes `/api` suffix
- **Fix**: Added `/api` prefix to all import-shipments API calls in ImportCosting.jsx

### 2. Admin-Only Edit for Sales & Purchase Registers ✅
- Added `isAdmin` check from `useAuth()` hook
- Sales Register: Orange pencil Edit button visible only for admin
- Purchase Register: Orange pencil Edit button visible only for admin
- Edit dialogs allow correcting: HSN code, Quantity, Rate, GST%, Discount, Party State, Payment Status, Notes
- Changes tracked with `edited_by`, `edited_by_name`, `edited_at` fields

**New Backend Endpoints:**
- `PUT /api/sales-invoices/{invoice_id}` - Admin-only invoice editing
- `PATCH /api/purchases/{purchase_id}` - Updated for admin-only with expanded editable fields

### 3. Enhanced GST Planning Data ✅
- **Output GST**: Now calculated from `sales_invoices` collection with CGST/SGST/IGST breakdown
- **Input GST**: Now calculated from `purchases` collection with CGST/SGST/IGST breakdown
- **Net GST Payable**: Correctly calculated as `Output GST - Input GST - ITC Balance`
- **Frontend**: Updated to show detailed GST breakdown in Finance & GST Planning tab

---

### Import Costing Engine ✅

A comprehensive tool for calculating landed costs of imported goods with full GST/ITC tracking.

**Features:**
- **Assessable Value Calculation (UPDATED April 9, 2026)**: Auto-calculates assessable value using standard customs rules
  - `Assessable Value = Invoice Value + Freight + Insurance`
  - **Freight**: Default 20% of invoice value (customs standard) OR manual USD entry
  - **Insurance**: Default 1.125% of invoice value (customs standard) OR manual USD entry
  - User can switch between "% of Invoice" or "Manual USD" for each
  - Real-time display showing Invoice + Freight + Insurance = Total USD → INR conversion
- **Exchange Rate Calculation**: Auto-calculates USD→INR rate from proforma USD amount vs bank INR debit
- **Multi-Item Support**: Multiple items with different HSN codes and BCD rates in single shipment
- **Duty Calculations**: BCD (variable %), SWS (10% of BCD), IGST (18% on assessable + BCD + SWS)
- **Expense Tracking**: Handling fees, shipping, bank charges - all with GST
- **Firm-wise Tracking**: Each import shipment is associated with a specific firm

**Outputs:**
1. **Landed Cost per SKU**: Total cost including assessable value + duties + prorated expenses
2. **Cost per Unit**: Per-unit landed cost
3. **Cost per Unit (without GST)**: Effective cost after ITC claim - this is the true procurement cost
4. **GST Input Total (ITC)**: IGST at customs + GST on expenses - claimable amount
5. **Effective Cost After ITC**: Grand total minus IGST (since IGST is recoverable)

**Integration:**
- On finalization, creates **Purchase Register** entry with full duty breakdown
- Creates **Expense Ledger** entries for each expense (with GST marked as claimable)

**Location:** Finance → Import Costing

## Bug Fixes (April 9, 2026)

### FIXED: Stock Transfer Entries Showing Blank Values in Registers ✅

**Issue**: Stock transfers created sales/purchase register entries with blank item names and no values (Taxable, GST, Total showed as empty).

**Root Cause**: The `create_stock_transfer` function in backend was creating `sales_invoices` and `purchases` with different field names than what the frontend expected:
- Sales: Used `subtotal`/`gst_amount`/`total_amount` instead of `taxable_value`/`total_gst`/`grand_total`
- Items: Used `description` instead of `name`, missing `rate`/`taxable_value`

**Fix Applied**:
1. **Backend (`server.py`)**: Updated stock transfer to create invoices/purchases with consistent field names:
   - Added `taxable_value`, `total_gst`, `grand_total` at top level
   - Added proper `name`, `rate`, `taxable_value` fields in items array
   - Added `total_taxable`, `total_gst` for purchases

2. **Frontend (`SalesRegister.jsx` & `PurchaseRegister.jsx`)**:
   - Added fallback field mappings (e.g., `taxable_value || subtotal || 0`)
   - Fixed item display to handle alternative field names
   - Fixed stats calculations to handle null values

**Verification**: Stock transfer entries now display correctly with proper item names and values.

---

### FIXED: Salary Payments Not Appearing in Expense Ledger ✅

**Issue**: When admin marked salaries as "Paid" via the Payroll module, the payments were not showing up in the Expenses & Tax Credits dashboard.

**Root Cause**: The `bulk_mark_payroll_paid` endpoint only updated the payroll status to "paid" but did NOT create corresponding entries in the `expense_ledger` collection. The single `mark_payroll_paid` endpoint correctly created expense entries, but bulk payments did not.

**Fix Applied**:
1. **Backend (`server.py`)**: Updated `bulk_mark_payroll_paid` function to:
   - Fetch all eligible payroll records before marking them paid
   - Create expense ledger entries for each payroll (matching the single payment logic)
   - Include full breakdown: fixed_salary, incentives, bonus, reimbursements, deductions
   - Also mark associated incentives as paid

2. **Frontend (`ExpensesDashboard.jsx`)**: 
   - Added fetch from `/admin/expenses` endpoint with `category: salary` filter
   - Combined salary expenses with regular expenses in the UI
   - Added "Salary Payments" stat card (cyan color)
   - Added "salary" category to `EXPENSE_CATEGORIES` with Users icon

**Verification**: Salary payments now appear in Expenses & Tax Credits dashboard with proper categorization.

## Recent Changes (April 8, 2026)

### NEW: Multi-Item Pending Fulfillment Entries ✅

**Feature**: Accountant can now add multiple products in a single pending fulfillment entry.

**Use Case**: Orders with multiple SKUs can now be tracked as a single entry with proper stock tracking for each item.

**UI Components**:
- **"Products" Section** - Border box with "Products *" label
- **"Add Product" Button** - Adds new product row
- **Product Row** - SKU dropdown + Quantity input + Remove button (trash icon)
- **Table Display** - Shows all items per entry with SKU code and quantity (e.g., "MG24V120AH x2")

**Backend Changes**:
- New `PendingFulfillmentItem` model: `{master_sku_id, quantity}`
- Updated `PendingFulfillmentCreate` to accept `items` array (multiple items) OR `master_sku_id` (backward compatibility)
- Each item stored with: `master_sku_id`, `master_sku_name`, `sku_code`, `hsn_code`, `gst_rate`, `quantity`, `current_stock`
- `all_items_in_stock` flag indicates if all items have sufficient stock
- Mark Ready checks stock for ALL items before proceeding

**Validation**:
- At least one item required
- Invalid SKU rejected
- Duplicate order_id / tracking_id rejected

---

### Amazon Historical Order Sync & Reconciliation ✅

**Feature**: Sync and process historical Amazon orders (already shipped on Amazon) for CRM reconciliation.

**Use Case**: Orders dispatched on Amazon before CRM integration can now be pulled and processed through the CRM dispatch flow.

**UI Components**:
- **"Amazon History" Stats Card** - Purple card showing count of shipped orders not yet processed in CRM
- **"Fetch Amazon History" Section** - Date picker (default: April 1, 2026) + "Fetch History" button
- **"Amazon History" Tab** - Lists orders with `crm_status: amazon_shipped`
- **"Process in CRM" Button** - Opens dialog for history orders requiring customer details
- **"Sync" Button** - For orders with missing items, refreshes items from Amazon API

**Items Display Enhancement**:
- Shows product name, SKU code, quantity
- **Green "Mapped" badge** - SKU is mapped to Master SKU
- **Red "Unmapped" badge** - SKU needs mapping before processing
- **"Sync" button** - Appears for orders with no items, calls `/api/amazon/refresh-order-items/{order_id}`

**Full Dispatch Workflow for History Orders**:
1. Accountant clicks "Fetch History" → Pulls `Shipped` status orders from Amazon (date filter)
2. Orders appear in "Amazon History" tab with "Process in CRM" button
3. Accountant clicks "Process in CRM" → Enters tracking + customer details (name, phone, city, state, pincode)
4. Order moves to **Pending Fulfillment Queue** (`pending_dispatch` status)
5. Accountant clicks "Mark Ready" → System checks stock via `get_current_stock()` → Status: `ready_to_dispatch`
6. Accountant dispatches from **Outbound Dispatch Queue** → Creates:
   - Dispatch entry with state/city/pincode (for state-wise sales)
   - Sales Order (`order_source: 'amazon'`)
   - Inventory Ledger entry (`dispatch_out` type)
7. Amazon order `crm_status` updates to `dispatched`

**API Endpoints Added/Updated**:
- `POST /api/amazon/fetch-orders/{firm_id}?order_status=Shipped&created_after_date=YYYY-MM-DD`
- `POST /api/amazon/refresh-order-items/{amazon_order_id}?firm_id={firm_id}` - NEW
- `GET /api/amazon/orders/{firm_id}` - Returns `amazon_shipped` in stats
- `POST /api/amazon/update-tracking` - Accepts `is_history_order` flag

**GST/HSN/Invoice Data**:
- Master SKU contains HSN code → flows to Sales Invoice
- Sales Invoice creation from dispatch captures: items, HSN, GST rate, taxable value
- State-wise sales reporting uses `state` field from dispatch/sales_order

---

## Previous Changes (April 5, 2026)

### ENHANCED: Amazon Order Flow - SKU Mapping Required ✅

**New Validation**: Cannot add tracking to Amazon orders until ALL SKUs are mapped to Master SKUs.

**UI Changes**:
- Banner: "12 Amazon SKU(s) need mapping" with "Map SKUs" button
- **"Map SKUs First"** badge (red) shown for orders with unmapped items
- **"Add Tracking"** button only enabled for orders with ALL SKUs mapped
- **"Unmapped"** badge (yellow) shown next to unmapped item names

**Backend Validation**:
- `POST /api/amazon/update-tracking` checks SKU mappings before allowing tracking
- Returns 400 error with list of unmapped SKUs if any are missing
- Pending fulfillment entry now includes `master_sku_id`, `sku_code`, `quantity` for inventory tracking

**Benefits**:
- Prevents inventory tracking issues (unmapped SKUs can't be checked against stock)
- Ensures proper sales order generation with correct product data
- Forces data hygiene before order processing

---

### ENHANCED: Push to Amazon - Better Error Handling ✅

**403 Permission Error**: Now provides helpful guidance:
> "Amazon API access denied. Please ensure your SP-API app has 'Direct-to-Consumer Shipping' role enabled in Seller Central and the refresh token has correct scopes."

**How to Fix 403**:
1. Go to Amazon Seller Central → Apps & Services → Develop Apps
2. Edit your SP-API app
3. Add "Direct-to-Consumer Shipping" role
4. Re-authorize and generate new refresh token

---

### FIX: Amazon Orders → Pending Fulfillment Status ✅

**Issue**: Amazon orders with tracking weren't showing in Pending Fulfillment Queue.

**Root Cause**: Status was `"pending"` but UI filters for `"pending_dispatch"`.

**Fix**: 
- Updated `amazon/update-tracking` to set `status: "pending_dispatch"`
- Added fix endpoint: `PUT /api/pending-fulfillment/fix-amazon-status`
- Existing orders fixed - now visible in queue

---

### FIX: GST/HSN Dashboard - Now Shows Correct Values ✅

**Issue**: GST/HSN Dashboard was showing ₹0 for taxable value and GST amounts.

**Root Cause**: Aggregation pipeline was using `$line_items` but sales invoices use `$items` array. Also needed to aggregate from dispatches for orders without invoices.

**Fix Applied**:
- Updated HSN summary aggregation to use `items` array from sales_invoices
- Added fallback aggregation from dispatches for orders without invoices
- Properly joins with `master_skus` collection for HSN code lookup

**Verification**: Dashboard now shows HSN 903290 (Stabilizer) with Taxable ₹2,900, IGST ₹522.

---

### FIX: Expenses Dashboard - Rent Amounts Now Display Correctly ✅

**Issue**: Rent entries showed ₹0 amount in Expenses & Tax Credits dashboard.

**Root Cause**: Dashboard used `e.amount` but manual expenses store in `gross_amount` field.

**Fix Applied**: Updated calculation to use `gross_amount || amount || 0` pattern.

**Verification**: Rent entries now display ₹50,000 correctly.

---

### CLARIFICATION: TDS Management vs Expenses (User Education)

**TDS Management shows 0 entries** - This is CORRECT behavior!

**Why**: TDS is only deducted when payment exceeds threshold:
- Section 194I (Rent): Threshold is ₹240,000/year
- User's rent entries (₹50,000) are below threshold, so no TDS deduction

**Key Distinction**:
- **TDS Management**: Shows TDS entries where company actually deducted TDS
- **Expenses & Tax Credits**: Shows ALL expenses regardless of TDS

If user wants TDS to be deducted on rent:
1. Create expense with amount > ₹240,000 (annual rent threshold)
2. OR accumulate rent payments and deduct TDS on last payment of year

---

### NEW: Amazon "Push to Amazon" Button ✅

**Feature**: Added ability to push tracking information to Amazon after adding it locally.

**Implementation**:
1. **Tracking Dialog** now has two buttons:
   - **Save & Queue Only**: Saves tracking locally, adds to Pending Fulfillment queue
   - **Save & Push to Amazon**: Saves tracking AND submits to Amazon SP-API

2. **New Endpoint**: `POST /api/amazon/push-tracking`
   - Uses Amazon SP-API Orders confirmShipment endpoint
   - Maps carrier codes to Amazon carrier names
   - Updates order with `amazon_tracking_pushed: true` on success

3. **Retry Capability**: Orders in "Tracking Added" status show "Push to Amazon" button if not already pushed

**Files Updated**:
- `/app/backend/server.py` - Added `/amazon/push-tracking` endpoint
- `/app/frontend/src/pages/operations/AmazonOrders.jsx` - Updated tracking dialog

---

### ENHANCED: TDS Calculation - Auto-Detect Section from Expense Type ✅

**Change**: TDS calculation now auto-detects TDS section from expense type even if party doesn't have `tds_applicable: true`.

**Benefit**: User doesn't need to pre-configure party with TDS settings. System will automatically:
1. Match expense type to TDS section (e.g., "rent" → 194I)
2. Check threshold requirements
3. Calculate TDS if applicable

---

### ENHANCED: Amazon MFN & Easy Ship Dispatch Flow ✅

---

### BUG FIX: Orders Page Not Showing Amazon/Flipkart Dispatches ✅

**Issue**: User reported dispatched items (amazon_order, flipkart_order types) were not visible under Sales > Orders > New Orders tab.

**Root Cause**: The `AdminOrders.jsx` was filtering only `dispatch_type=new_order`, missing `amazon_order`, `flipkart_order`, `website_order` dispatch types.

**Fix Applied**: Updated `/app/frontend/src/pages/admin/AdminOrders.jsx` to include all new order dispatch types:
- `new_order`

### FIX: PRODUCTION RECEIVE INVENTORY LEDGER BUG (P0) ✅

Fixed critical bug in Production Receive workflow where raw materials were being consumed incorrectly and manufactured items showed wrong quantities.

**Original Issues:**
1. Raw materials could be partially consumed if a later BOM item failed stock check (leading to duplicate consumption on retry)
2. Production Output entries showed `-1` (red/negative) in the inventory ledger dialog instead of `+1` (green/positive)

**Root Causes:**
1. Backend: The `receive_production_into_inventory` endpoint created ledger entries WHILE validating materials in the same loop. If material #3 failed validation, materials #1 and #2 were already consumed.
2. Frontend: The `production_output` entry type was missing from the positive entry types list in both the table and dialog display logic.

**Fixes Applied:**
1. **Backend** (`/app/backend/server.py` lines 9826-9885):
   - Separated validation phase from creation phase
   - First validates ALL BOM materials have sufficient stock
   - Only THEN creates consumption ledger entries
   - Atomic operation: all-or-nothing validation

2. **Frontend** (`AccountantInventory.jsx`):
   - Added `production_output`, `return_in`, `repair_yard_in` to positive entry types
   - Applied `Math.abs()` to quantity display for consistent rendering
   - Fixed dialog (lines 1723-1731) and table (lines 838-844)

3. **Frontend** (`StockReports.jsx`):

**Issue:** OTP login for customers and dealers was not working. Users would enter the correct OTP but get "Invalid OTP" error.

**Root Cause:** Three issues were identified:
1. **localStorage key mismatch:** `LoginPage.jsx` was using `localStorage.setItem('token', ...)` but `App.js` AuthContext was looking for `mg_token`
2. **Missing AuthContext exports:** `setToken` and `setUser` functions were not exported from `AuthContext.Provider`, causing `setToken is not a function` error
3. **Missing UserResponse fields:** The `UserResponse` Pydantic model was missing `profile_incomplete` and `missing_fields` fields, so after verification the frontend couldn't determine if user needed to complete their profile

**Fix:**
1. Changed `localStorage.setItem('token', ...)` to `localStorage.setItem('mg_token', ...)` in `LoginPage.jsx` and `DealerLogin.jsx`
2. Added `setUser` and `setToken` to the `AuthContext.Provider` value in `App.js`
3. Added `profile_incomplete: Optional[bool]` and `missing_fields: Optional[list]` to `UserResponse` model in `server.py`

**Files Modified:**
- `/app/frontend/src/pages/LoginPage.jsx` (line 77)
- `/app/frontend/src/pages/dealer/DealerLogin.jsx` (line 90)
- `/app/frontend/src/App.js` (line 153)
- `/app/backend/server.py` (lines 182-195)

**Testing:**
- ✅ Customer OTP login redirects to `/complete-profile` if profile incomplete
- ✅ Customer OTP login redirects to `/customer` if profile complete
- ✅ Admin email login redirects to `/admin`
- ✅ Backend OTP APIs return correct response with profile_incomplete field

### BUG FIXES (March 27, 2026)

#### 1. DEALER PORTAL NAVIGATION FIX ✅ (CRITICAL)
**Issue:** Dealer Portal sidebar links not working - clicking tabs showed no data and page refresh logged out the dealer.

**Root Cause:** The `/api/auth/me` endpoint was failing with a 500 error because migrated dealer users had `created_at` stored as a Python `datetime` object instead of an ISO string. The `UserResponse` Pydantic model expected a string, causing validation failure.

**Fix:** Updated `/api/auth/me` and `/api/auth/me` (PATCH) endpoints to convert `datetime` objects to ISO strings before returning the response.

## Understanding the Sales Invoice → Dispatch Relationship

**What is a Dispatch?**
A "dispatch" in this CRM is an outbound shipment record created when goods are sent to a customer. It contains:
- Customer details (name, phone, address)
- Product/SKU being shipped
- Quantity and price
- Shipping/courier details
- Dispatch status

**Why Sales Invoice requires a Dispatch?**
The design enforces that every sales invoice MUST be linked to a physical dispatch. This ensures:
1. No invoice can be created without actual goods being shipped
2. Prevents double-invoicing (one dispatch = one invoice)
3. Maintains audit trail between shipment and billing

**"No dispatches without invoice" means:**
All existing dispatches already have invoices created for them. To create a new sales invoice, you need a dispatch that hasn't been invoiced yet.

**Workflow:**
1. Create dispatch in "Outbound Dispatch" page
2. Once dispatch is created → it appears in Sales Register
3. Create invoice by selecting the dispatch
4. Invoice auto-links to dispatch, dispatch marked as invoiced

## File Storage Migration - COMPLETED (March 29, 2026)

### Synology File API Integration
- Replaced WebDAV with custom File API hosted on Synology NAS
- Base URL: `https://files.musclegrid.in`
- Authentication: `x-api-key` header

### API Endpoints
- `POST /upload/:folder` - Upload file (multipart/form-data, field: "file")
- `GET /download/:folder/:filename` - Download file
- `GET /files/:folder` - List files in folder
- `DELETE /file/:folder/:filename` - Delete file

### Valid Folders
- tickets, invoices, payments, certificates

### Folder Mapping (Backwards Compatibility)
Legacy folder names are automatically mapped:
- pickup_labels, dispatch_labels, labels → tickets
- service_invoices, warranty_invoices, purchase_invoices, quotations → invoices
- payment_proofs, deposits, dealer_deposits, dealer_payments → payments
- feedback_screenshots, reviews, dealer_tickets, dealer_documents → tickets

### Configuration
```
FILE_API_URL=https://files.musclegrid.in
FILE_API_KEY=<configured in .env>
```

### Files Updated
- `/app/backend/utils/storage.py` - Complete rewrite for File API
- `/app/backend/server.py` - All upload endpoints use storage utility
- `/app/backend/.env` - FILE_API_URL and FILE_API_KEY configured
